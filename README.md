# Rails Latest Migration

Adds a shortcut for quickly opening up the latest migration in your Rails app.

Ported over from my Sublime Text plugin by the same name: [Rails Latest Migration - Sublime](https://github.com/alexpls/Rails-Latest-Migration).

[Find Rails Latest Migration on the atom.io package manager here.](https://atom.io/packages/rails-latest-migration)
